# Info
Game Metrics is a project to analyze trends in NBA (possibly more sports) data.
Our main goal is to predict critical statistics for sports betting, fantasy sports,
and other fields that may benefit from prediction.

# Getting Started
## Requirements
Please download Conda to install the Python dependencies needed for this project.

You may also want to install Jupyter Notebook system-wide, but not necessary as it is provided
within the conda environment.

## Setup
Install conda dependencies using this command in terminal:
```conda env create -f game_metrics_env.yml```
